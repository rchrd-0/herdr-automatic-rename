# naming.sh - pure, herdr-free name computation for herdr-automatic-rename.
#
# Sourced by automatic-rename.sh. Every function is string-in / string-out (no herdr
# or filesystem calls) so the logic is unit-testable on its own (see
# tests/test_naming.sh). Targets bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash): no associative
# arrays, no namerefs. Functions share the ar_ prefix with the engine, which
# calls ar_label across the module seam.
#
# Two environment variables are read for DEFAULTS, both below: $SHELL names the
# shell a bare prompt is labeled with, and $HOME is the directory ar_context_dir
# treats as nowhere in particular. Neither is looked up per call.
#
# Naming rule: a tab is named after its foreground program (nvim, claude, git,
# ...). At a bare prompt, or while a quick throwaway command runs, it shows the
# shell name (e.g. zsh) instead -- or nothing at all with HIDE_SHELL=1. Loosely
# modeled on tmux-window-name, minus the directory-based naming.
#
# Every list below is guarded with `declare -p` rather than `${VAR+x}`, so
# clearing one in config.sh (e.g. IGNORED_PROGRAMS=()) actually takes effect:
# `${VAR+x}` reports a zero-element array as unset and would overwrite it.

# Icon knobs, the glyph map, and ar_icon live in icons.sh (same directory) so
# this file stays free of the 100+ entry glyph table. Sourcing it here keeps
# every caller of naming.sh (automatic-rename.sh and the test suite) working
# unchanged. icons.sh loads after config.sh has run, so its defaults only fill
# unset vars.

# The ACTIVITY half of a label -- the program, or an agent's task -- is cut to

# MAX_BRANCH_LEN are the others), so the whole is bounded by construction and
# there is no total to keep in step with the parts.

# 1 = name a tab running a coding agent after the task the agent reports in its
# terminal title ("Squash merge command"), rather than after the agent program
# ("claude"). Coding agents keep that title current as the work changes, so this
# is what tells five claude tabs apart. herdr publishes it on the pane, so the
# name costs no extra call -- and where it lands the tab needs no process lookup
# at all. 0 names every agent tab after its program, as before.
#
# A title only replaces the program name when it says something: see
# ar_title_clean for what gets refused. Whenever it refuses, naming falls back to
# the program, PROGRAM_ALIASES included.
: "${AGENT_TITLES:=1}"

# What an agent tab shows once AGENT_TITLES has a task to show. "task" is the
# released answer: the task alone, the agent having been replaced by it.
# "name_and_task" keeps both, joined by a colon -- "claude:auth-flow", or through
# PROGRAM_ALIASES "cc:auth-flow".
#
# Which agent is on a task is not otherwise recoverable from the tab. The icon map
# gives every agent herdr detects the same robot glyph, deliberately so, and a
# title then replaces the one place the program name appeared. That is fine for a
# session of one agent and loses something in a session of three, where "cc:" and
# "oc:" are the difference between two tabs that otherwise read alike.
#
# The name is priced into MAX_TITLE_LEN with everything else, so it is the task
# that gives up the characters, not the tab that grows. Where a title is refused
# nothing is prefixed: the tab falls back to the program name, and "cc:cc" says
# nothing twice. Any other value reads as "task".
: "${TITLE_STYLE:=task}"

# The least task worth printing beside a name. The prefix is dropped rather than
# shown alone when the budget cannot seat both, so this is what "both" means: a

# word and a hyphen; below that the tab says who far more loudly than what.

# Truncate a title to this many characters, at a word boundary where one is close
# enough. Titles are sentences, not command names, so they get more room than a

# and tell each other apart by position only. 0 names by the program alone, as
# before.
#
# The switch is read inside ar_context_dir rather than at each call site, because
# the reconcile and the shell hook both compute labels and a label they disagree
# about is a tab that flips on every prompt.

# a sentence, and the program beside it still needs the room MAX_NAME_LEN gives

# 1 = qualify the context with the branch the pane's repository has checked out:
# "api > MC-13675 > nvim". It says which slice of a project a tab is on, where
# the directory alone says only which project. 0 leaves branches out, and so
# does MAX_BRANCH_LEN=0.
: "${SHOW_BRANCH:=1}"

# The branches treated as a trunk when the repository records no default of its
# own -- one cloned without an origin/HEAD, or one that was never cloned. A
# repository that DOES record one is believed over this list, so a team whose
# trunk is "release" is not second-guessed. Assigning the array replaces the

# is yours, "<brand> ! ..." when it wants you, and "<brand>: ..." with its title
# state off, so its brand arrives in front of the status glyph rather than behind
# it. The spinner strip only takes a LEADING run of non-alphanumerics and jq reads
# the brand as a letter, so the strip stopped on it and each of those states
# reached the tab as a different label: the glyph on show, and a rename on every
# status change (issue #12). Naming the brand takes it off and leaves the separator
# to the strip that was already there -- so a title of nothing but brand and glyph
# empties out and the tab falls back to the program name, which is the answer an
# agent with no task wants.
#
# Only at the very front, and only with a non-alphanumeric behind it, so a title
# that merely starts with the same letter keeps it. Matched ignoring the case of
# ASCII letters, like every other title compare. The brand is written as its bytes
# for the reason icons.sh writes its glyphs that way: a literal one is what an
# editor eats without saying so. "pi" and "omp" are both canonical herdr agent
# kinds (src/detect/mod.rs, herdr 0.8.2) and both are the same program's brand.
#
# opencode brands the same way with letters rather than a glyph, "OC | Reviewing
# unpushed commits", and an "opencode=OC" entry does strip it. It is deliberately
# NOT in the default here. debrand takes a brand off wherever a non-alphanumeric
# or the end of the string follows it, matching ASCII case-insensitively, which is
# wider than a badge before a pipe: it also takes "OC" off "OC-192 incident" and

# the words that say WHICH task this is are the first to go. Condensing drops a
# leading verb and the filler and joins what is left, which fits the same budget
# while keeping the nouns: "screensaver-timeout".
#
# Off by default, so a config that does not name it gets the title exactly as
# AGENT_TITLES has always rendered it. That is also what keeps this a bolt-on:
# every released test asserts the sentence, and a default of 1 would rewrite
# their expectations rather than add to them.

# Verbs an agent opens a title with. Every tab reading "Fix ..." or "Add ..."

#
# Measured rather than imagined. The corpus is the LAST title Claude Code
# generated in each of the 65 titled sessions on one machine over three weeks,
# which is the title the engine itself reads (transcript.sh takes last(inputs)).
# Measuring the first title instead gives 36 and 31, one session having been
# retitled while it ran; the numbers below are the selection that ships.
#
# The other 1735 transcripts there are subagent runs and headless "sdk-cli"
# invocations, neither of which Claude Code titles at all. Those are unlikely to
# be sitting in a tab somebody is reading, though nothing stops one being launched
# in a terminal, so read this as "titled sessions" rather than "every tab".
#
# THIS list fires on 35 of the 65, and 30 of those get a content word back inside
# the same budget. No two DIFFERENT titles among the 65 condense to the same
# label with the list on or off, so the drop buys information without costing
# distinctness. (Two of the 65 are the same title from two sessions, and those
# do condense alike, which is the corpus repeating itself rather than the rule
# losing anything.) "analyze" was
# the most frequent opener the first hand-written list had missed, seven of the
# 65; "troubleshoot", "optimize" and "show" one each.
#
# "port" was taken OUT on judgement, not on evidence: the word appears nowhere in

# often than a verb in the work these titles describe.
#
# One population is NOT measured here. Where an agent never titled its session,
# the engine condenses the first prompt the user typed instead, and those are
# phrased differently from a title an agent wrote. On this machine that group is
# all headless automation, so it could not be sampled.
#
# The list matches spelling, not part of speech, so a title whose subject shares
# a verb's spelling loses it. The failure that matters is two tabs colliding:
# "Review flashcard generation" and "Implement flashcard generation" both reduce
# to "flashcard-generation". It did not happen across those 65, but the corpus is
